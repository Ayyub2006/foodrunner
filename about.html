      <h2>About the Founder</h2>
    <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Mohd Ayyub Khan, a 3rd year B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student at PIEMR, Indore. I specialize in Java Full-Stack Development and have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and MySQL. <br><br>

From January 2025 to August 2025, I worked on my solo major project â€“ Food Runner, a comprehensive web development project that reflects my passion for creating real-world solutions. Food Runner allows users to order food online and locate nearby stores and restaurants using Google Maps integration.

This project is more than just a learning milestone â€” it showcases my ability to design, develop, and deploy user-friendly web applications with a focus on functionality, performance, and elegant UI/UX.</p>
